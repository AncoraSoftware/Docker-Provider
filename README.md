# Branches

- `ci_prod` branch contains codebase currently in production (or being prepared for release).
- `ci_dev` branch contains version in development.

To contribute: create your private branch off of `ci_dev`, make changes and use pull request to merge back to `ci_dev`.
Pull request must be approved by at least one engineering team members.

# Authoring code

We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for authoring. Windows 10 with Ubuntu App can be used for both Windows and Linux  Agent development and recommened to clone the code onto Ubuntu app so that you dont need to worry about line ending issues LF vs CRLF.

# Building code

## Linux Agent

### Install Pre-requisites

1. Install go1.14.1, dotnet, powershell, docker and build dependencies to build go code for both Linux and Windows platforms
```
bash ~/Docker-Provider/scripts/build/linux/install-build-pre-requisites.sh
```
2. Verify python, docker and golang installed properly and also PATH and GOBIN environment variables set with go bin path.
   For some reason go env not set by install-build-pre-requisites.sh script, run the following commands to set them
   ```
   export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
   export GOBIN=/usr/local/go/bin
   ```
3. If you want to use Docker on the WSL2, verify following configuration settings configured on your Ubuntu app
   ```
   echo $DOCKER_HOST
   # if either DOCKER_HOST not set already or doesnt have tcp://localhost:2375 value, set DOCKER_HOST value via this command
   echo "export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://localhost:2375" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
   # on Docker Desktop for Windows make sure docker running linux mode and enabled Expose daemon on tcp://localhost:2375 without TLS
   ```

### Build Docker Provider Shell Bundle and Docker Image and Publish Docker Image

> Note: If you are using WSL2, ensure Docker for windows running Linux containers mode to build Linux agent image successfully

```
cd ~/Docker-Provider/kubernetes/linux/dockerbuild
sudo docker login # if you want to publish the image to acr then login to acr via `docker login <acr-name>`
# build provider, docker image and publish to docker image
bash build-and-publish-docker-image.sh --image <repo>/<imagename>:<imagetag>
```
> Note: format of the imagetag will be `ci<release><MMDDYYYY>`. possible values for release are test, dev, preview, dogfood, prod etc.

If you prefer to build docker provider shell bundle and image separately, then you can follow below instructions

##### Build Docker Provider shell bundle

```
cd ~/Docker-Provider/build/linux
make
```
##### Build and Push Docker Image

```
cd ~/Docker-Provider/kubernetes/linux/
docker build -t <repo>/<imagename>:<imagetag> --build-arg IMAGE_TAG=<imagetag> .
docker push <repo>/<imagename>:<imagetag>
```
## Windows Agent

### Install Pre-requisites

If you are planning to build the .net and go code for windows agent on Linux machine and you have already have Docker for Windows on Windows machine, then you may skip this.

```
powershell # launch powershell with elevated admin on your windows machine
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy bypass # set the execution policy
net use z: \\wsl$\Ubuntu-16.04 # map the network drive of the ubuntu app to windows
cd z:\home\sshadmin\Docker-Provider\scripts\build\windows # based on your repo path
.\install-build-pre-requisites.ps1 #
```
#### Build Certificate Generator Source code and Out OMS Go plugin code

> Note: .net and go code for windows agent can built on Ubuntu

```
cd ~/Docker-Provider/build/windows # based on your repo path on ubuntu or WSL2
pwsh #switch to powershell
.\Makefile.ps1 # trigger build and publish of .net and go code
```
> Note: format of the imagetag will be `win-ci<release><MMDDYYYY>`. possible values for release are test, dev, preview, dogfood, prod etc.

####  Build and Push Docker Image

> Note: windows container can only built on windows hence you will have to execute below commands on windows via accessing network share or copying published bits omsagentwindows under kubernetes directory on to windows machine

```
net use z: \\wsl$\Ubuntu-16.04 # map the network drive of the ubuntu app to windows
cd z:\home\sshadmin\Docker-Provider\kubernetes\windows # based on your repo path
docker build -t <repo>/<imagename>:<imagetag> --build-arg IMAGE_TAG=<imagetag> .
docker push <repo>/<imagename>:<imagetag>
```

### Build Cert generator, Out OMS Plugun and Docker Image and Publish Docker Image

If you have code cloned on to windows, you can built everything for windows agent on windows machine via below instructions

```
cd %userprofile%\Docker-Provider\kubernetes\windows\dockerbuild # based on your repo path
docker login # if you want to publish the image to acr then login to acr via `docker login <acr-name>`
powershell -ExecutionPolicy bypass  # switch to powershell if you are not on powershell already
.\build-and-publish-docker-image.ps1 -image <repo>/<imagename>:<imagetag> # trigger build code and image and publish docker hub or acr
```

# Azure DevOps Build Pipeline

Navigate to https://github-private.visualstudio.com/microsoft/_build?view=pipelines to see Linux and Windows Agent build pipelines. These pipelines are configured with CI triggers for ci_dev and ci_prod.

Docker Images will be pushed to CDPX ACR repos and these needs to retagged and pushed to corresponding ACR or docker hub. Only onboarded Azure AD AppId has permission to pull the images from CDPx ACRs.

Please reach out the agent engineering team if you need access to it.

## Onboarding feature branch

Here are the instructions to onboard the feature branch to Azure Dev Ops pipeline

 1. Navigate to https://github-private.visualstudio.com/microsoft/_apps/hub/azurecdp.cdpx-onboarding.cdpx-onboarding-tab
 2. Select the repository as "docker-provider" from repository drop down
 3. click on validate repository
 4. select the your feature branch from Branch drop down
 5. Select the Operation system as "Linux" and Build type as "buddy"
 6. create build definition
 7. enable continous integration on trigger on the build definition

 This will create build definition for the Linux agent.
 Repeat above steps except that this time select Operation system as "Windows" to onboard the pipeline for Windows agent.

# Azure DevOps Release Pipeline

Integrated to Azure DevOps release pipeline for the ci_dev and ci_prod.With this, for every commit to ci_dev branch, latest bits automatically deployded to DEV AKS clusters in Build subscription and similarly for for every commit to ci_prod branch, latest bits automatically deployed to PROD AKS clusters in Build subscription.

For dev, agent image will be in this format mcr.microsoft.com/azuremonitor/containerinsights/cidev:cidev<git-commit-id>.
For prod, agent will be in this format mcr.microsoft.com/azuremonitor/containerinsights/ciprod:ciprod`<MM><DD><YYYY>`.

Navigate to https://github-private.visualstudio.com/microsoft/_release?_a=releases&view=all to see the release pipelines.

# Update Kubernetes yamls

Navigate to Kubernetes directory and update the yamls with latest docker image of Linux and Windows Agent and other relevant updates.

#  Deployment and Validation

For DEV and PROD branches, automatically deployed latest yaml with latest agent image (which automatically built by the azure devops pipeline) onto CIDEV and CIPROD AKS clusters in build subscription.  So, you can use CIDEV and CIPROD AKS cluster to validate E2E. Similarly, you can set up build and release pipelines for your feature branch.

# E2E Tests

Clusters are used in release pipeline already has the yamls under test\scenario deployed. Make sure to validate these scenarios.
If you have new interesting scenarios, please add/update them.
